My name is Raghav Saboo and I work as a Machine Learning Engineer in New York City. I spend a lot of time (procrastinating) by reading and curating knowledge from different sources. In 2021 I decided to do this publicly through my wiki.

This blog is a place for me to condense many of my notes in my wiki into something that is hopefully as beneficial for you as it is for me. I hope to write three kinds of posts on this blog:

1. Explanatory
2. Exploratory
3. Descriptive. 

I will aim for my explanatory notes to be comprehensive and only on topics that I consider myself to have sufficient command over. Exploratory posts will consists mainly of a literature review of sorts that I have gathered and consolidated with hopes of maturing it to an explanatory post one day. Finally the descriptive posts are going to be free spirited and even without purpose; they exist only as streams of my thoughts (and often opinions).

Writing is often deeply personal, and always selfish. It has not escaped me that there is already a lot of noise on the internet and this small space adds to it. Yet I can't resist.

Please do reach out using any of the social channels linked to the left.

I hope you enjoy your stay here!
